## dotfiles

These are my **personal** dotfiles, they *may* or *may not* work for you. I'm using [ianishathalye/dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) for installing the dotfiles.

### What's included?

Configuration files, scripts, and instructions for Linux and Darwin (OS X) systems.
Check each **dotfile** to see what's included.

### Installation

To install simply go to the dotfiles folder and run the `install` script:

```
cd [DOTFILES FOLDER]
./install
```

You should be able to see able to see if anything went wrong.

### Follow system-specific instructions

- [Linux](README.linux.md)
- [Darwin](README.darwin.md)
